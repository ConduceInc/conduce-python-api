==================
Conduce Python API
==================

What's covered here
-------------------
Conduce is a data visualization platform design to enable users to integrate data from disparate systems and present them for analysis and discovery. The Python API provides users with a mechanism to ingest data, construct visualization components called lenses, and display those lenses on a two-dimensional substrate, like a map or floor plan, within the Conduce environment. This document provides a detailed description of the Python API and provides examples of its use.
